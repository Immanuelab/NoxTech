# Website
It is my website for digital media assesment

This website will be developed in html, css, javascript, using visual studio code as a code editor. I will also use github as my website server and version control. I will not heavily consider the look of the website on a mobile environment, and it is expected to be viewed on chromium engine browsers on Windows 10.

Current development environment:
CPU structure: x86-64
OS: Windows 10 home 64-bit / 2004 / 19041
Browser: Chromium Engine Edge
Native Language of OS & Browser: Korean
